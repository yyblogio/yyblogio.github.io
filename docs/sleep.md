# Sleep

Sleep is essential throughout our entire life. As the book [*Why We Sleep: Unlocking the Power of Sleep and Dreams*](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34466963-why-we-sleep?ref=nav_sb_ss_1_12) says, everyone needs 8 hours of sleep each day. Otherwise, we may suffer negative effects from insufficient sleep. So, prioritize your sleep and try to get a full nightâ€™s rest without interruptions.
