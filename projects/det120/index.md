# DET 120
I plan to study in Ireland next year.  
Because I'm not a native English speaker, I need to provide a report from an English exam.

I've noticed that the [DET](https://www.englishtest.duolingo.com/) (Duolingo English Test) is an affordable option for me, and many universities acknowledge it, such as [DCU](https://www.dcu.ie/registry/english-language-requirements-non-native-speakers-english-registry#tab-114966-2:~:text=in%20all%20components.-,Duolingo,-Duolingo%20will%20be).

So in this project, I will improve my English skills and aim for a score of 120.  
I'll record my progress during my preparation for the test.
